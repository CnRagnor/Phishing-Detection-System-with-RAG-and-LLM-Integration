## Overview
The Phishing Detection System aims to develop a robust and accurate system capable of detecting and flagging potential phishing emails and websites. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, this system enhances cybersecurity and protects users from phishing attacks.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- **Identify Suspicious Emails and Websites**: Detect phishing attempts by analyzing the content of emails and websites.
- **Prevent Phishing Attacks**: Safeguard users from falling victim to phishing by flagging potential threats.
- **Reduce Risk**: Minimize the chances of sensitive information being compromised.
- **Educate Users**: Increase awareness about phishing threats and teach users how to recognize them.

## Technologies Used
The Phishing Detection System integrates several advanced technologies:
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Employs pre-trained transformer models like BERT and GPT-3 for text analysis and contextual understanding.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines LLMs with retrieval mechanisms to improve system performance.

## Components

### Large Language Model (LLM)
We'll use pre-trained transformer models for Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Effective for text classification tasks and identifying phishing content.
- **GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3)**: Generates contextual embeddings for email content analysis.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Combines language models with a retrieval mechanism to enhance performance:
- **Retrieval Mechanism**: Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for vector-based retrieval of relevant documents and email templates.
- **Knowledge Base**: Maintains a repository of known phishing patterns and legitimate templates.

### APIs and Libraries
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Provides access to pre-trained models like BERT and GPT-3.
- **FAISS**: Efficient similarity search and retrieval.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: Text processing and feature extraction.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms for model training and evaluation.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up Environment**: Install required libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install transformers faiss-cpu nltk scikit-learn
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```python
    !pip install transformers faiss-cpu nltk scikit-learn
    ```

3. **Import Libraries**:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
    import faiss
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    ```

4. **Data Collection**:
    ```python
    import kagglehub
    # Download latest version
    path = kagglehub.dataset_download("naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset")
    print("Path to dataset files:", path)
    ```

5. **Tokenize Email Content**:
    ```python
    from transformers import BertTokenizer
    tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
    data['tokens'] = data['processed_text'].apply(lambda x: tokenizer.encode(x, add_special_tokens=True, max_length=512, truncation=True))
    print(data.head())
    ```

## Working

### Data Collection
- Collect phishing and legitimate email datasets from Kaggle and other sources.
- Store the data in structured formats for preprocessing.

### Feature Extraction
- Use NLP techniques to preprocess the text content.
- Tokenize the email content using pre-trained BERT tokenizer.
- Extract relevant features for machine learning models.

### Machine Learning Model Training
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train machine learning models like decision trees, random forests, SVMs, and neural networks.
- Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Phishing Detection
- Implement the trained model to analyze new email content.
- Use the retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant phishing patterns.
- Flag potential phishing emails and websites.

### User Interface
- Develop a user-friendly interface for users to upload and analyze emails.
- Display results and provide feedback on detected threats.

### Continuous Improvement
- Continuously update the knowledge base with new phishing patterns.
- Retrain models periodically to improve detection accuracy.

## Potential Features
- **Real-time Analysis**: Enable real-time phishing detection for incoming emails.
- **Browser Extension**: Develop a browser extension to analyze websites for phishing threats.
- **User Reporting**: Allow users to report suspicious emails and websites to improve the system.

## Conclusion
The Phishing Detection System aims to enhance cybersecurity by detecting and flagging potential phishing emails and websites. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, large language models, and retrieval-augmented generation techniques, this system provides a comprehensive solution to mitigate phishing threats.
